# Employee_Compensation_Prediction_Model
Capstone Project developed during Data science and Machine learning program. This showcases my knowledge and skill during the program.
- Problem statement:
Project objective is to develop a compensation prediction model, this project understands how Employee compensation affect by other variables such as salary, benfits, overtime, retirement, health and dental based on the jobs.
- Data Collection:
Dataset Source - https://data.world/data-society/employee-compensation-in-sf (Note: First login to dataworld to access dataset)
The data consists of 22 column and 291825 rows.
- Data Cleaning:
Removed unwanted columns, handled missing values, outliers
- Data Analysis:
Explored the data and create visualizations to summarize the data.
- Model Creation and Evaluation
Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, DecisionTree, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting and K Neighbors were used for machine learning models training and mean absolute error was calculated.
- Conclusion:
The aim of this project was to create best regression model for the employee salary compensation dataset and to predict the compensation paid. This helps the San Francisco Controller's Office to have better planning of their budget and resources to help prevent under or over estimations and maintain a stable calculation through the years to come. The best model performed is Linear Regression because it has the lowest average discrepancy between actual and predicted value compared to other models. Linear Regression can forecast the compensation with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.17% which are a very good results with a lower error rate.
